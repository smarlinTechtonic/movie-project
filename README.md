# Movie Web Code Test

This code test will evaluate your abilities to develop a React+Redux application, using web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

For this test you will be adding functionality to an app for viewing movies. You will utilize an existing local API server for movie search and the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for detailed movie information.

Start client app and API server:
1. From the root:
    >```npm start```

2. Verify server running: http://localhost:3001/movies/all
